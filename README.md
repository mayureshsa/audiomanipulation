# audiomanipulation
Simulating the process of manipulation of audio signal (.wav files) from different musical instruments using SciLab functions.
3 audio files i.e. drums.wav, guitar.wav and bass.wav serve as the sources of audio signals in the program. These are then combined at different frequencies at varying degrees to produce unique sound each time.
The waveform of these outputs are plotted in the Graphical user Interface window provided to ease user experience.
